# Task 3: Seed the Database with Sample Data

## Overview

This task involves creating SQL `INSERT` statements to populate the database with realistic sample data for the entities in the ALX Airbnb-like application. The goal is to simulate real-world usage by adding multiple users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, and messages.

### **Sample Data**

The sample data includes:

- **Users**: Three sample users (a guest, a host, and an admin) with various roles.
- **Properties**: Three properties listed by a host, with various descriptions and price points.
- **Bookings**: Bookings made by the guest for different properties.
- **Payments**: Payments associated with the bookings.
- **Reviews**: Reviews left by the guest for properties they stayed in.
- **Messages**: Messages exchanged between users (guests and hosts).
