## About the Project

This project is part of the comprehensive Airbnb Database Module. It focuses on:
- Database design and normalization.
- Schema creation using SQL.
- Populating the database with realistic sample data.
- Simulating real-world scenarios with an Airbnb-like application.

By completing this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with real-world database challenges, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and adherence to industry standards.

## Learning Objectives

As a professional developer, completing these tasks will empower you to:
- Apply advanced principles of database design to model complex systems.
- Master the art of normalization to optimize database efficiency and minimize redundancy.
- Use SQL DDL to define database schema with appropriate constraints, keys, and indexing.
- Write and execute SQL DML scripts to seed databases with realistic sample data.
- Enhance collaboration skills by managing repositories, documenting processes, and adhering to professional submission standards.

## Requirements

To successfully complete these tasks, you must:
- Have a strong foundation in relational databases and SQL.
- Be proficient in using Draw.io or similar tools for visual modeling.
- Possess a good understanding of data normalization principles (up to 3NF).
- Have experience with GitHub repositories for documentation and project submission.
- Follow industry best practices for database design and scripting.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Define Entities and Relationships in ER Diagram
Objective: Create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram based on the database specification.
- Identify all entities (e.g., User, Property, Booking) and their attributes.
- Define relationships between entities.
- Use Draw.io or similar tools for visual modeling.

### Task 2: Normalize Your Database Design
Objective: Apply normalization principles to ensure the database is in the third normal form (3NF).
- Review the schema and identify potential redundancies.
- Document the normalization steps in a Markdown file.

### Task 3: Design Database Schema (DDL)
Objective: Write SQL queries to define the database schema.
- Create `CREATE TABLE` statements with proper constraints.
- Define primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes for optimal performance.

### Task 4: Seed the Database with Sample Data
Objective: Populate the database with realistic sample data.
- Write `INSERT` statements for tables (e.g., User, Property, Booking).
- Ensure sample data reflects real-world usage.
